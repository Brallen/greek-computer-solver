# What is this?
This is a small script that solves the [Greek Computer Puzzle](https://www.projectgeniusinc.com/grecian-computer-solution) using a brute force solution.
Because it is solved using brute force, the script is not super efficient. However, since there are only a relatively small number of calculations needed,
the script finishes in under a second.

# Why do this?
I had some free time during a vacation and had this puzzle around. I tried to solve it without using a computer to get the combination but then figured 
programming a solution could be a fun way to spend some time. This is the outcome of the hour or two I spent working on this while rewatching Breaking Bad.
